# 🌍 World Time Application

A lightweight Flutter app that fetches and displays the current time for any city in the world using a REST API. Built by following [The Net Ninja's Flutter World Time tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ukSR1GRtMU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ), this project helped me understand asynchronous programming, routing, and API integration in Flutter.
